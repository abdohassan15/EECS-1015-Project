High-Low Game in Python
A fun, interactive game built using Python! In this game, the player starts with 100 points and has ten rounds to try and reach 500 points by betting on whether the next card will be higher or lower than the current card. Each round, the player can bet some of their points, and if their guess is correct, they win the bet amount. If incorrect, they lose the bet amount. The game continues until the player either wins 500 points, runs out of points, or completes 10 rounds.

Key Features:
- Random card generation (cards from 2 to 14, represented by "2"-"9", "T", "J", "Q", "K", "A").
- Player guesses if the next card will be higher or lower.
- Players can place bets based on their current point total.
- Includes stopping conditions based on points or rounds.
- Provides a summary of the game results, including the number of rounds won or lost.
- Win the game by reaching 500 points in 10 rounds.
- Lose if the player runs out of points before reaching 500 or if they finish all 10 rounds without reaching 500 points.

Objective:
The goal of this project is to practice Python programming by using core concepts, including:
- Function Definitions & Calling:
  Create reusable functions for drawing cards, handling input, and checking guesses, helping you understand modular code.
String Processing & Handling Input:
- Work with string inputs for guesses (e.g., "HIGH" or "LOW"), validate inputs, and convert card values (e.g., 10 -> "T", 11 -> "J").
Conditionals & Boolean Expressions:
- Implement decision-making based on player guesses and card comparisons using if and else statements.
Loops & Iteration:
- Use loops to run rounds, validate input, and repeat tasks until a stopping condition is met.
Random Number Generation:
- Use Python's random library to generate random cards, simulating an unpredictable game outcome.
Function Return Values & Parameters:
- Pass data into and out of functions (e.g., for betting amounts or checking guesses), reinforcing understanding of function mechanics.

Finally ...
This project is a great way to practice Python functions, loops, conditional statements, and random number generation.
